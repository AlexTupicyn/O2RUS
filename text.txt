-71 5.2.1.04  Driver's Demand Engine - Percent Torque  
 The requested torque output of the engine by the driver. It is based on input from the following requestors external to the   powertrain: operator (via the accelerator pedal), cruise control and/or road speed limit governor. Dynamic commands from   internal powertrain functions such as smoke control, low- and high-speed engine governing; ASR and shift control are   excluded from this calculation. The data is transmitted in indicated torque as a percent of the reference engine torque. See   5.3.17 for the engine configuration message. Several status bits are defined separately to indicate the request which is   currently being honored. This parameter may be used for shift scheduling.

 -71 5.2.1.15  Requested Torque  
 Parameter provided to the engine or retarder in the torque/speed control message for controlling or limiting the output torque.  
  
   Requested torque to the engine is measured in indicated torque as a percentage of reference engine torque (see the engine   configuration message, 5.3.17).  This is the engine torque at which the engine is expected to operate if the torque control   mode is active or the engine torque which the engine is not expected to exceed if the torque limit mode is active.  
   Zero torque can be requested which implies zero fuel and, according to Figures 2 and 3, the engine will not be allowed to   stall.  The actual engine percent torque (5.2.1.5) should be zero and the engine should decelerate until the low idle governor   kicks in, at which time the actual engine percent torque will be calculated as shown in Figures 2 and 3 and the engine torque   mode bits (5.2.2.1) should be equal to 00002 - Low Idle Governor.  
   Requested torque to the retarder is measured in indicated torque as a percentage of reference retarder torque (see the   retarder configuration message, 5.3.15).  The logic used in enabling or disabling the retarder is based on the override control    mode priority bits (5.2.3.3).  
   A zero torque request to the retarder is a disable request, and is used by a J1939 node to prevent the retarder from being   activated by other combinations of inputs outside of J1939 commands. The Torque Limit Mode is commonly used for this   purpose.   Slot Length:  1 byte

When preparing to send a request to a retarder, the states of the Retarder Enable - Shift Assist Switch and the 
Retarder Enable - Brake Assist Switch must be checked by the requesting device to determine whether the request may be sent to the Retarder. Figure 4 shows how those switches and other operator and network inputs are used to create the actual retarder operating point on a system-wide basis. The Retarder may or may not be the device reading the actual switches; even if it is, it will not accept or reject a request based on its knowledge of 
the switch states. Its function is to send the switch states via J1939 (in its ERC1 message) and it expects other 
J1939 nodes to honor those switch states by refraining from sending inappropriate commands.  Several elements affect the retarder besides the Requested Torque parameter in the TSC1 message. These elements are not looked at by the retarder itself, but are used by various other devices to determine if they may 
ask the retarder to be engaged. These are the Retarder Enable Shift Assist Switch, and the Retarder Enable 
Brake Assist Switch. The relationship between those switches and the retarder (as well as that between the operator and retarder) is described in Figure 4.

Tables 5 and 6 identify many use cases.  Each row is the summary of one or more uses.  One of the 
primary communications provided by these tables is that the retarder can be activated by the J1939 TSC1 message, although the operator input is “off.”

Footnotes: 
1. Note that the TSC1 inputs will override Operator Torque Selection. The J1939 devices that generate the TSC1 messages will assure that the Retarder Enable Brake Assist Switch and Retarder Enable Shift 
Assist Switch are enabled as appropriate before commanding the Retarder to engage. See sections 
5.2.2.11 and 5.2.2.12 for descriptions of these switches.  Also, for the purposes of this table, it is assumed that if the TSC1, Destination Retarder message is requesting Retarder Torque, no other TSC1, 
Destination Engine messages are requesting engine fueling. That arbitration is beyond the scope of this 
section. 2. This refers to the torque requested by the cruise control, and does not refer to the cruise switches.  
Cruise control is defined to be on and engaged in this column. The cruise control should not request 
retarder torque unless the Retarder Enable - Brake Assist Switch is enabled. 3. The Accelerator Pedal is inherently incapable of requesting negative torque. It may have no particular 
torque demands, or it may request some engine fueling, which prevents the retarder from engaging. 
Consequently, the chart is complete even though no rows exist for the AP to request retarder torque. 4. The Operator Torque Request is incapable of requesting positive torque. The table is complete without 
the Operator Torque Request asking for positive Engine Torque 
5. This description assumes no other switch (such as brake pedal depressed) is needed in order for the operator torque request to initiate retarder braking. Other implementation specific rules would apply if 
such a catalyst were needed. 
 Table 6 shows the relationship between various inputs and an after engine retarder.  
The biggest difference between this type of retarder and an engine brake is that the exhaust brake may 
be engaged while the engine is still being fueled. Also, if cruise control is communicating with the retarder, it would do so using the TSC1 message. 
 
Consequently, columns for accelerator pedal input and cruise control input would only serve to confuse the issue of retarder availability in Table 6.

 -71 5.2.1.16  Engine's Desired Operating Speed Asymmetry Adjustment  
 This byte is utilized in transmission gear selection routines and indicates the engine's preference of lower versus higher   engine speeds should its desired speed not be achievable.  This is a scaled ratio such that 125 represents an equal   preference for a speed lower or higher that the engine's indicated desired speed.  The higher the asymmetry adjustment   value is above 125, the more the engine prefers to be operated at or above its indicated desired speed.  Conversely, the   lower the asymmetry adjustment value is below 125, the more the engine prefers to operate at or below its indicated desired   speed.  Typically, the engine's asymmetry adjustment will be predicated on fuel consumption considerations, and under   these conditions, the method for computing the asymmetry adjustment is indicated in Figure 5. The engine may include   other factors into its asymmetry adjustment calculation such as temperatures, pressures, and other operating parameters.

 The torque limit that indicates the available engine torque which can be provided by the engine at point 2 of the engine map   (see 5.2.4.1).  In engine configuration mode 1 and 3 (see Table 11), point 2 is defined as the kick-in point from which torque   is reduced to zero.  In mode 2, there are no special requirements for the definition of this point.  The data is transmitted in    indicated torque as a percent of the reference engine torque.

 State signal which indicates which engine torque mode is currently generating, limiting, or controlling the torque.  Note that   the modes are not in prioritized order. Not all modes may be relevant for a given device.  Some devices may not implement    all functions.  For typical priorities refer to Figures 23 and 34 for engine control and Tables 5 to 6 for retarder control.  The   data type of this parameter is measured.  (Reference: 5.3.3, 5.3.7)  
   Mode 00002 means “No request”: engine torque may range from 0 to full load only due to low idle governor output; retarder   torque = 0 (no braking).  
   Modes 00012 to 11102 indicate that there is either a torque request or the identified function is currently controlling the   engine/retarder: engine/retarder torque may range from 0 (no fueling/no braking) to the upper limit.

5.2.2.1.1  Low Idle Governor/No request (Default mode) This mode is active if the accelerator pedal (not 
necessarily the torque output of the driver input, see Figure 3 and Figure 4) is zero.  This is the default mode.  
At low speed, the low idle governor may be active while at higher speed, it is zero. 
 
5.2.2.1.2  Accelerator Pedal This mode is active if the accelerator pedal position is active (being followed).  This 
mode is active for the retarder if it is turned on by the operator.  Note that it may be disabled by the accelerator 
pedal or clutch switches (operator selection). 
 
5.2.2.1.3  Cruise Control This mode is active if cruise control is active and greater than the accelerator pedal 
request. 
 
5.2.2.1.4  PTO Governor This mode is active if the PTO governor is active. 
 
5.2.2.1.5  Road Speed Governing Indicates that road speed governing is active and limiting torque.

Control). 
 
5.2.2.1.7  Transmission Control Indicates that the transmission command is active (Speed, Torque, or 
Speed/Torque Limit Control). 
 
5.2.2.1.8  ABS Control Indicates that the ABS is controlling torque. 
 
5.2.2.1.9  Torque Limiting This mode is active if the demanded or commanded engine torque is limited by internal 
logic due to full load, smoke and/or emissions control, engine protection and/or other factors.  A reduced 
torque limit may be necessary for engine protection if the engine temperature is too high or a sensor fails 
(speed, timing, or boost pressure), as examples. 
 
5.2.2.1.10  High Speed Governor This mode is active if the engine is controlled by the high speed governor due 
to normal operation. 
 
5.2.2.1.11  Brake System (Electronic) This indicates that the brake pedal is controlling the torque.  Note that this 
may include enabling of the retarder when the brake pedal is depressed (touched). 
  Note that if there is a request to the retarder but operating conditions do not allow braking, this situation will be 
reflected by the Percent Retarder Torque = 0 when broadcast.

 -71 5.2.2.01  Retarder Torque Mode  
 State signal which indicates which retarder torque mode is currently generating, limiting, or controlling the torque.  Note tha t   the modes are not in prioritized order. Not all modes may be relevant for a given device.  Some devices may not implement    all functions.  For typical priorities refer to Figures 23 and 34 for engine control and Tables 5 to 6 for retarder control.  The   data type of this parameter is measured.  (Reference: 5.3.3, 5.3.7)  
   Mode 00002 means “No request”: engine torque may range from 0 to full load only due to low idle governor output; retarder   torque = 0 (no braking).  
  
 Modes 00012 to 11102 indicate that there is either a torque request or the identified function is currently controlling the   engine/retarder: engine/retarder torque may range from 0 (no fueling/no braking) to the upper limit.

 -71 5.2.2.02  Retarder Type  
 A vehicle retarder is a supplementary device to the wheel brakes for the driver to better control the vehicle.  The wheel   brakes used in the vehicle are not designed for continuous retarding operation.  In a prolonged period of braking, the brakes   can be thermally over-stressed, causing the braking effect to be reduced or even lead to complete braking system failure.    The vehicle retarder is designed for continuous operation for braking during downhill operation and is also used for braking   the vehicle to comply with speed limits and traffic conditions.  
   This parameter provides some indication of the retarder dynamics.  It is used in the retarder configuration message  (See   5.3.15).  The data type of this parameter is measured.

5.2.2.2.1  Electric/Magnetic Retarder The electric/magnetic retarder functions by creating eddy currents 
generated in a conductive armature when placed in a variable magnetic field.  Currently, electric retarders 
have a stator on which field coils are mounted.  The rotors, mounted on both sides of the drive shaft, are ribbed for heat dissipation.  In order to brake the vehicle, voltage is applied to the field coils which generate a magnetic field inducing eddy currents in the rotors as they pass thro ugh the field.  Magnetic retarders use a 
permanent magnet to generate the eddy currents.  Braking-torque is dependent on stator excitation and on the 
air gap between the rotor and the stator. 
 
5.2.2.2.2  Hydraulic Retarder The hydraulic retarder is a hydrodynamic coupling device.  Two impellers which 
face each other, a rotor and a stator, are filled with oil.  When the rotor, which is connected to the vehicle drive 
shaft rotates, it drives the oil in the direction of rotation.  The mechanical energy produced by the rotor is converted into kinetic energy in the operating fluid.  Hydrodynamic coupling between the rotor and stator converts the kinetic energy into heat and the rotor is retarded.  This retardation effect is transmitted to the drive 
shaft and the vehicle is retarded. 
 
5.2.2.2.3  Cooled Friction Brake The cooled friction brake uses air or hydraulic fluid to dissipate heat from the 
friction surface of the service brake.  By controlling the friction surface temperature, retarding torque is 
improved, along with a reduced rate of wear. 
5.2.2.2.4  Compression Release Engine Retarder The compression release engine retarder converts a power-
producing diesel engine into a power-absorbing retarding mechanism by opening the exhaust valve near the 
top dead center in the engine compression cycle.  No positive power will be produced, since the compressed 
air mass is released.  The vehicle is retarded as it must provide energy to compress the cylinder air charge 
and subsequently to return the piston to the bottom position. 
 
5.2.2.2.5  Exhaust Brake The exhaust brake restricts the escape of the exhaust gas from the exhaust manifold. 
Each succeeding exhaust stroke builds up a back pressure in the manifold which exerts a retarding effect to 
the pistons during the exhaust stroke.  The engine turns against this back pressure creating a braking effect to 
the vehicle. 
 
5.2.2.2.6  Auxiliary Retarder Fans, air conditioners, or any power-absorbing device in the vehicle can also 
function as retarders as they impose parasitic loading on the engine or vehicle. 
 
 -71 5.2.2.03  Retarder Location

 -71 5.2.3.01  Override Control Mode  
 The override control mode defines which sort of command is used:  
   00 Override disabled - Disable any existing control commanded by the source of this command.   01 Speed control - Govern speed to the included “desired speed” value.   10 Torque control - Control torque to the included “desired torque” value.   11 Speed/torque limit control - Limit speed and/or torque based on the included limit values.  The speed limit governor is a   droop governor where the speed limit value defines the speed at the maximum torque available during this operation.  
   If a device wants to know whether it has access to the engine, there are several possibilities:  
   a. Comparing its command with the actual engine broadcasts.  
 b. Looking at command modes from other devices.   c. Looking to the engine and retarder torque mode.  
   Remarks:  
   a. The realization of a torque limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the speed limit to a high value (FAFF16).   b. The realization of a speed limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the torque limit to a high value (FA16).   c. Limiting the retarder torque means to limit the magnitude of the torque request.  As the brake torque is represented by   negative torque values, the limitation must be done by a maximum selection of the requested torque and the retarder   internal torque signals.   d. For torque increasing functions, time limits for the torque or speed value (command) and the direct modes are desirable.  
   e. The selection of which device has control of the engine's speed or torque depends on the override mode priority (see   5.2.3.3) with the highest priority device gaining control.  In the case of two devices with identical priority, the engine   responds to speed/torque control commands over speed/torque limit commands and will act on the speed or torque   commands on a first come, first served basis.  The torque limit will be a “lowest wins” selection (e.g., if one device   commands 60% limit and another 80% limit, then the engine will limit torque to 60%).  Figure 89 provides a flowchart of the   torque/speed control priority selection logic.

 -71 5.2.3.02  Requested Speed Control Conditions  
 This mode tells the engine control system the governor characteristics that are desired during speed control.  The four   characteristics defined are:  
   00 Transient Optimized for driveline disengaged and non-lockup conditions   01 Stability Optimized for driveline disengaged and non-lockup conditions   10 Stability Optimized for driveline engaged and/or in lockup condition 1 (e.g., vehicle driveline)   11 Stability Optimized for driveline engaged and/or in lockup condition 2 (e.g., PTO driveline)  
   5.2.3.2.1  Speed Control Characteristic 00 This speed governor gain selection is adjusted to provide rapid transition between   speed setpoints.  RPM overshoot and undershoot may be greater than what is seen when the “speed control characteristic”   is set to be stability optimized.  
   5.2.3.2.2  Speed Control Characteristic 01 This control condition has been optimized to minimize rpm overshoot and   undershoot given an expected plant consisting of the engine and its accessory loads.  This gain adjustment is not intended   to compensate for driveline characteristics.  This characteristic is most appropriate when no driveline is connected.  
   5.2.3.2.3  Speed Control Characteristic 10 This control condition has been optimized to minimize rpm overshoot and   undershoot given a more complex plant.  For instance, the more complex plant would contain the engine, its accessory   loads and the driveline characteristics.  As an example, the driveline characteristics might include the effective spring mass    relationship of pumps, tires, clutches, axles, driveshafts, and multiple gear ratios.  This characteristic is most appropriate    when a driveline is engaged.  
   5.2.3.2.4  Speed Control Characteristic 11 This speed control characteristic is available for applications requiring   compensation for more than one driveline characteristic.  It has been optimized to minimize rpm overshoot and undershoot   given a more complex plant of the second variety.  This more complex plant would again contain the engine, its accessory   loads and a second driveline characteristic unique from the one described in speed control characteristic 10.

 -71 5.2.3.03  Override Control Mode Priority  
 This field is used as an input to the engine or retarder to determine the priority of the Override Control Mode received in the    Torque/Speed Control message (see 5.3.1).  The default is 11 (Low priority).  It is not required to use the same priority   during the entire override function.  For example, the transmission can use priority 01 (High priority) during a shift, but can    set the priority to 11 (Low priority) at the end of the shift to allow traction control to also interact with the torque limit of the   engine.  
   The four priority levels defined are:  
   00 Highest priority   01 High priority   10 Medium priority   11 Low priority  
   5.2.3.3.1  Highest Priority  00 Used for situations that require immediate action by the receiving device in order to provide   safe vehicle operation (i.e., braking systems).  This level of priority should only be used in safety critical conditions.  
   5.2.3.3.2  High Priority  01 Used for control situations that require prompt action in order to provide safe vehicle operation.     An example is when the transmission is performing a shift and requires control of the engine in order to control driveline   reengagement.  
   5.2.3.3.3  Medium Priority  10 Used for powertrain control operations which are related to assuring that the vehicle is in a   stable operating condition.  An example is when the traction control system is commanding the engine in order to achieve   traction stability.  
   5.2.3.3.4  Low Priority  11 Used to indicate that the associated command desires powertrain control but is needed for  
 function which improves the driver comfort which may be overridden by other devices.  An example is cruise control or the   non-critical part of a transmission shift to a new gear.

conditions for shutdown no longer exist before the "X" time interval has expired or EPS Approaching Shutdown is activated. 
 
  Condition 2 – When the EPS Timer Override is inactive and conditions for shutdown exist during the "Y" time

   Condition 3 – When the EPS Timer Override is active, then the EPS feature shall be overridden allowing for an 
engine failure when the "Z" time interval has expired. 
   Condition 4 – When the EPS Timer Override is active and then allowed to go inactive during the "Y" time interval, 
the response by the EPS shall be the same as condition 2. The time intervals for "X" and "Y" shall always start when conditions for shutdown first commence regardless whether the EPS Timer Override is enabled or not.

 -71 5.2.6.087  Adaptive Cruise Control Mode  
 This parameter is used to indicate the current state, or mode, of operation by the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) device.   The states characterize independent system states (e.g., it is not possible to express distance control active and overtake   mode simultaneously). See Table 24. ACC must not switch itself off while active because the driver expects it to work. So   if an error occurs, the ACC   must signal that to the driver so that the driver knows that he has to switch off the ACC.  
   000 Off (Standby, enabled, ready for activation)   001 Speed control active   010 Distance control active   011 Overtake mode   100 HOLD   101 Finish mode   110 Disabled or error condition   111 Not available/not valid  
   5.2.6.87.1 Off 000—Used to indicate the ACC is enabled in calibration or configuration and there are no faults that would   prevent the system from operating.   5.2.6.87.2 Speed Control Active 001—Used to indicate that ACC is on but not currently sending control messages.  In other   words, there is no target ahead and regular vehicle cruise control is controlling the vehicle speed to the driver’s set speed.    5.2.6.87.3 Distance Control Active 010—Used to indicate that ACC is on and actively sending control messages to   maintain the appropriate following interval.   5.2.6.87.4 Overtake Mode 011—Used to indicate that ACC is on but temporarily disabled because the driver is manually   overriding cruise control by using either the accelerator pedal or the cruise control “accel” switch.   5.2.6.87.5 Hold Mode 100 - Used to indicate that the ACC has lost the previous target vehicle and is in HOLD mode. In this   mode, the ACC shall limit the speed to the speed held when the target was lost. For example,  if the driver activates the   typical cruise buttons (Resume/Inc/Dec) the HOLD mode shall be exited and normal cruise functionality resumed. If a new   target is detected, the Distance Control Active mode (010) is again entered, unless existing conditions prohibit this.   5.2.6.87.6 Finish Mode 101—Used to indicate that ACC is on with no target ahead, and ACC is currently sending control   messages to return to the driver’s set speed. This occurs when the target the ACC system was tracking moves out of the   way so ACC returns the vehicle to the driver’s set speed.   5.2.6.87.7 Disabled or Error Condition 110—Used to indicate that ACC is in an error state and can not operate.

 This is the maximum amount of torque that the retarder can immediately deliver.   It is the same as the maximum torque   shown in the Retarder’s Configuration message, but allows for a much faster rate of change than could be communicated   by reissuing the configuration message.   Application Note: The purpose for this parameter is to allow a “Master” retarder controller to more accurately allocate the   vehicle’s retarder requirements among multiple retarders. Its value should be the same as the value in the Configuration   message at the time that message is assembled for broadcast, but may vary between those broadcasts.

   These heights are discrete levels.  They are the upper level, lower level, normal level 1, normal level 2, normal level 3,   customer level, and preset level.  Refer to Figure ?????.  
   · Upper Level is the highest mechanically available height of the vehicle.    · Lower Level is the lowest mechanically available height of the vehicle.   
   Normal Levels 1, 2 and 3 are heights normally used during driving.   · Normal Level 1 is most often used and is given by design.   
 · Normal Level 2 may be chosen, for example, to be lower than Normal Level 1 for the purpose of reducing fuel   consumption while driving on highways.    · Normal Level 3 may be chosen above Normal Level 1 for driving off road.  
   The preset level has to be set by means of ASC 6 (PGN: 53504).

If the vehicle height, to be controlled by the ASC, is not within the tolerances of the defined nominal 
levels, the nominal level is set to not specified. 
 The defined vehicle heights can be activated via the ASC 2 (PGN: 53760) message or via a remote control (see figure below). The remote control is an external unit to operate the suspension system.

An example: The nominal level is the normal level 1. Via remote control a new nominal level (for 
instance upper level) is requested. The nominal level is then set to upper level and during the height modification the ASC is indicating that the actual level is below nominal level until the upper level is reached.

 -71 5.2.7.???  Transmission torque limit  
 Parameter provided to the engine from the transmission as a torque limit to be invoked by the engine in the event that   J1939 communication with the transmission is lost.  
   The intention is to protect transmissions that use a continuous torque limit during torque converter mode or operation in   specific lower gears, where stall or drivetrain torque may reach levels higher than the gearbox capacity.  If communication   is lost during torque limited operation, unrestricted engine torque output could harm the transmission.  
   It is recommended that engines use reception of the ETC#1 message as a transmission “heartbeat”.  In the event that the   ETC#1 message is not received in a time period of 5 times its’ broadcast rate (5 x 10 ms = 50 ms), the engine should   invoke a torque limit holding the engine to less than or equal to the value of the Transmission Torque Limit parameter.  The   engine may release the limit when engine-to-transmission communication is re-established.  
   A value of FF00 to FFFF indicates that no transmission torque limit is desired.  
   It is expected that the engine will record this torque value in non-volatile memory and will include this in the engine   configuration PGN as parameter Default Engine Torque Limit.  
   If the engine observes change in this parameter value on power-up, the engine should record the new value.

 Companion parameter to Transmission Torque Limit (SPN 1845).  This “echo” parameter provides confirmation to the   transmission that the engine has received and will invoke the requested Transmission Torque Limit in the event that J1939   communication is lost between the two devices.  
   If the engine supports this protection logic, the Default Engine Torque Limit parameter should be set equal to the   Transmission Torque Limit parameter as received in the Transmission Configuration message (PGN 65250).  Otherwise, a   Default Engine Torque Limit value of FF00 to FFFF indicates that no default engine torque limit has been received or set.  
   The intention is to protect transmissions that use a continuous torque limit during torque converter mode or operation in   specific lower gears, where stall or drivetrain torque may reach levels higher than the gearbox capacity.  If communication   is lost during torque limited operation, unrestricted engine torque output could harm the transmission.

Background: 
 During periods of TSC#1 engine control, other devices on the J1939 network may wish to know where the engine wants to go once it is released from TSC#1 control.  In order for option transitions of driveline torque between different devices, it becomes necessary to understand the engine’s desired torque for all phases of a 
TSC#1 control sequence. 
 
Driver’s Demand Engine – Percent Torque (reference 5.2.1.4) provides a partial prediction of the torque the engine wishes to produce after a TSC#1 command is removed.  Included in Driver’s Demand Torque are external requestors to the powertrain such as accelerator pedal, cruise control, and road speed limit governors.  However, excluded  from DDT are (1) dynamic commands within the powertrain such as smoke control, noise 
control, and low and high speed engine governing, and (2) external TSC#1 commands to the engine such as 
those generated by traction control.   
 For a controller to properly determine the engine’s desired output torque during a TSC#1 sequence, it needs knowledge of the torque being scheduled by all active controls within the engine.  Since DDT excludes many of these active controllers from its calculation, it cannot be used to accurately predict the desired output torque.  
The effects of the external TSC#1 commands can be approximated by other devices by means of monitoring 
TSC#1 messages to the engine; however the effects of the engine’s internal dynamic commands are completely unknown and cannot be estimated.  
Actual Engine – Percent Torque (reference 5.2.1.5) provides a window to the engine’s desired torque 
output when no TSC#1 commands are actively controlling the engine.  However, when the engine is 
responding to TSC#1 commands, the Actual Engine – Percent Torque parameter is no longer indicative 
of the torque that the engine will produce once those TSC#1 commands are removed.   
 
In simplest terms, Engine Demand – Percent Torque (or “EDT”) contains the engine’s internal dynamic commands that are excluded from the Driver’s Demand Engine – Percent Torque definition, including smoke control, noise control, and low and high speed governing.  With this additional piece of information, devices on 
the network that are controlling the engine via TSC#1 messages can determine the torque direction of the 
engine once the current TSC#1 command is relinquished.  It is important to note that the proposed EDT parameter is used as information.  The addition of the EDT parameter should in no way cause a change to the engine’s actual torque command architecture. 
 
EDT Calculation: 
 
When no devices are controlling the engine via TSC#1 messages, the value of EDT is equal to the Actual Engine – Percent Torque parameter.   When the engine is
 being controlled via a TSC#1 message, it is necessary 
for the engine controller to calculate what its’ target torque would be  if there were no external commands being 
received.  This “runner up” in engine control will come from internal dynamic engine commands. 
 
In the calculation of Actual Engine – Percent Torque, the output of the engine’s idle governor must be 
considered, along with the impact of the engine’s full load governor, smoke controls and other internal limiting logic.  In the determination of the Engine Demand Torque parameter, these same engine logic components are needed, as indicated in Figure EDT1 .  However, there is a significant difference: These components only affect 
the Actual Engine – Percent Torque parameter determination if they are the component actively  controlling the 
engine.  In EDT, any of these components will be used to calculate EDT if they are the “runner up”  for engine 
control.  Even though these components may lose in the engine’s internal control arbitration, the engine output 
torque that they would produce if in command needs to be found to determine EDT.  If speed governors are involved in determining these components of the EDT calculation, any of the following 3 special cases may need to be addressed: 
 
Special Case #1:  Speed Governors 
 
If the engine governor referenced in Figure EDT1  is a speed-based governor instead of a throttle table 
arrangement, a new challenge is presented in determining EDT.  Since the speed governor output is directly influenced by the TSC#1 command in control (for example, integrator anti-windup logic), the speed governor’s 
output during TSC#1 commands cannot be used to calculate EDT.   
 Instead, an approximation  of the speed governor output without the effects of any TSC#1 commands is required 
for use in the EDT calculation.  “Approximation” refers to removing the effects of integrator terms and any other dynamic components that result from the controlling TSC#1 commands.  All elements affecting the speed governor reference should be included before the reference is translated into terms of torque. 
 
All control algorithms with dynamic elements (e.g., speed governors) that execute during TSC#1 
commands need to have their outputs replaced by “steady-state” approximations for use in the EDT calculation. Again note that these approximations are for use only in the EDT calculation; the actual engine control logic remains unchanged. 
 
Figure EDT4  illustrates EDT and speed governor output during a typical control sequence.  The output of the 
speed governor may tend to lag the engine’s torque trace during and after the TSC#1 command sequence.  Note however that the TSC#1’s influence is not factored into EDT; only when the command sequence ends or is no FIGURE EDT1 - TORQUE COMMANDS AND CALCULATIONS WHEN A “MAXIMUM

longer winning in terms of engine control arbitration do the dynamic effects of the speed governor(s) appear in 
the EDT signal. 
  
One method of converting the speed governor reference to torque is shown in Figure EDT5  above.  The inputs 
of current engine speed, accelerator pedal position and the shape of the governor droop curves can be used to 
find the equivalent torque output of the governor.  A lookup table or calculation could be used.   Special Case #2:  “Steep” or zero droop speed governors 
 
Using a steady-state approximation with a “steep” or zero droop speed governor can cause large EDT 
changes over small speed changes.  For example, if a cruise control governor has a zero droop and the 
vehicle speed is just below the cruise set speed, the steady-state torque approximation using the method described previously is very large.  If vehicle speed increases a small amount to above the cruise set speed, the steady-state torque approximation becomes very small or zero. 
 
As a result, a more accurate steady-state torque approximation is needed when steep droop governors 
are involved.  A steep droop speed governor is defined as having a droop slope greater than 0.2% 
actual torque per rpm as seen below in Figure EDT6 . 
 
The following method can be used to determine a steady-state torque approximation for steep or zero droop 
governors with fast responding integrator anti-windup / integrator resetting: 
 
1. Upon a TSC#1 message actively controlling engine torque, save the last value of torque commanded by the 
speed governor (
τSGo) and the last value of speed governor error ( εSGo). 
2. During this control sequence, calculate speed governor error ( εSGi) 
3. Calculate an estimated torque for EDT determination use: τSGestimated = τSGo + Kp SG * (εSGo- εSGi )  
where Kp SG is the speed governor proportional gain

If the speed governor dynamic elements are slow to respond to a 1 second torque derate, then the 
speed governor can simply be executed during the TSC#1 event and the output used directly in determining EDT.  This is an alternative for a speed governor which does not contain an integrator, or if 
the integrator anti-windup logic is slow to respond.  A guideline for “slow response” is that the governor 
output after 1 second of torque limiting has only moved 1/3 of the way to the limit, as shown for example 
in Figure EDT7 .

 NOTE- This message will be transmitted by several types of retarding devices such as engine compression  
 release brakes, exhaust system restriction brakes, and driveline retarders using hydraulic, electric, or  
 mechanical friction to slow the vehicle. The source address of the message will indicate which one, and the  
 type and location of the retarder are available in the Retarder Configuration Message (see 5.3.15) if that  
 detail is important to the receiver.  
  
 Users should also be aware that the Shift Assist and Brake Assist switch status in the first byte of this  
 message are to be used by other ECUs that might request retarding force from the retarder to know when  
 such assistance is available. The state of the “switches” will NOT prevent the retarder from activating if  
 requested, but should be honored by the requester (by not sending a request when the appropriate “switch” is  
 not enabled) to prevent unwarranted noise.

 -71 5.3.141  Adaptive Cruise Control  - ACC1 
 NOTE—The ACC1 message is required whenever the engine is running and ACC is powered on and not  
 faulted. The timeout for ACC1 message will be between 2.5 times to 5 times the update rate.  
  
 The ACC1 message is intended primarily for engines and driver display units. The receiving device  
 should identify the ACC device based on ACC function value of 32 (headway controller) or source  
 address of 42 (headway controller).  
 In the event that the engine is running, the ACC is installed and the ACC1 message is not present, the  
 engine will disable cruise control and return to non-cruise mode; also, the driver display unit will notify  
 the driver that ACC operation is no longer available. In addition to the ACC1 timeout, engine cruise  
 control will also be disabled if parameter "Adaptive Cruise Control State" in ACC1 is 1102 (ACC disabled  
 or in error). In some cases, it may be possible for the driver to restart cruise control (without ACC  
 capability) during ACC/J1939 fault by performing a reset function. See Figure 25.  
  
 It is possible that engines and driver display units may require calibration settings in order to know if the  
 present vehicle configuration includes an ACC system or not. A calibration setting may also be needed  
 for defining the driver reset function.

The TSC1 message allows J1939 network devices to temporarily control engine and retarder speed and 
torque.   This approach allows engine (and retarder) speed to be controlled by one device for a limited period of 
time.  This may need to happen for brief emergency conditions (as requested by an anti-lock braking system for 
example) or in order to synchronize engine speed with some other device such as a transmission in order to allow a 
shift. Conflicting speed and torque requests from different devices are resolved by a predefined arbitration scheme. 
  Not every torque or speed need is satisfactorily addressed by this plan, however.  Occasionally a network 
device may wish to impose longer lasting limits on speed and torque.  For instance, as long as a transmission is in 
third gear, it may not be able to withstand all the torque the engine (or retarder) can produce.  Or, an auxiliary device 
such as a pump may only operate correctly if engine speed and torque are kept within some fairly limited range but 
not necessarily at one precise speed/torque!  In these cases, the network device does not need to command the 
precise speed or torque, but does have a legitimate desire to keep it within some boundary for an extended period of time.  The TSC1 message doesn’t provide this ability. 
 
How:  The ECM and retarder controller(s) first must define a “window” within the torque map.  The window 
should be chosen carefully, and shouldn’t be any larger than necessary. Any requests for continuous limits that 
attempt to intrude on this window will succeed only in setting limits at the very threshold of the window.  For 
example, if the ECM declares that minimum continuous torque limits must be less than 900 lb-ft, and some device 
attempts to set a minimum continuous torque of 1000 lb-ft, the actual applied continuous limit will be 900 lb-ft (thus 900 lb-ft is the minimum  continuous  torque).  When this limit is applied, the engine will always produce at least 900 
lb-ft of torque.  Similarly, if the engine declares that minimum continuous engine speed cannot be more than 1100 
RPM, any attempts at setting a minimum continuous engine speed of over 1100 RPM will result in a minimum 
continuous engine speed of 1100 RPM. That is, the engine has declared beforehand that it will always  be able to 
operate at least at 1100 RPM.    
 Periodically, the ECM and retarder controller(s) will transmit the dimensions of this window, as well as 
what actual continuous limits have been applied.  This allows the engine to adjust the size and shape of the 
“window” to allow for derates and provides feedback to the various devices requesting continuous torque and/or 
speed limits. 
 
The following figure shows an example torque curve with a “window” inside.   
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 The following figure shows how the ECM will treat requests that are outside of the bounds set by the “window.”  
Note that the ECM has declared a “maximum allowable minimum” and a “minimum allowable maximum” for both 
speed and torque.  These limits form a sort of rectangular “window” within the torque. The engine must  be free to 
operate within this window; no continuous limits will be accepted that would intrude on it.  In the diagram, some 
network device has ignored those values and attempted to set a minimum continuous speed higher than allowed.  Remember, a minimum continuous speed means that the engine must always maintain an RPM of that value or 
greater.  The ECM cannot accept the requested limit, so it applies a continuous limit as close as possible: right at the 
boundary set by “maximum value allowed for minimum continuous speed.”  Requests for Minimum Continuous 
Speed and Max/Min continuous torque are handled the same way.

Things get a little more complicated when a retarder is included.  Fortunately, only the engine compression brake 
retarder has any real relationship to the engine’s torque map. Because other retarders may work against the engine, 
only the compression brake is generally controlled by the same ECU.  For this reason, we must give it more careful 
attention.

The following figure illustrates one of the problems.  Suppose continuous limits have been applied to the engine and 
retarder as indicated by the rectangular boxes within the torque maps.  If the engine is prohibited from allowing 
torque to decrease below x, how can the retarder be engaged?  An engine compression brake retarder needs zero 
fueling for the engine in order to engage.  The simple answer is that if there is a minimum continuous torque limit 
applied to the engine, the retarder will not be engaged. 
How does the reverse case behave?  If the retarder is of a type other than engine compression brake, it may work 
against the engine and continuously produce a negative torque.  Engine compression brake retarders must not send 
out a list of acceptable limits that would allow such conundrums.  In practical terms, this means that engine 
compression brake retarders must set their Maximum Continuous Torque limit (think of it as MINIMUM continuous 
BRAKING torque limit) to zero in order for the retarder to ever be engaged.  Similarly, the continuous limits as 
actually applied to the engine must allow zero torque if the retarder is to be engaged.

 implement work and driving lights.  Additional commands have been provided for 3 optional lights on  
 implements to meet the needs of speciality equipment.  Common marking and signaling messages are  
 provided.  
 This message is used to control the state of all lighting functions.  The lighting command message shall be  
 sent on each change of state of a lamp, or at periodic rate to provide synchronization of turn signal and  
 hazard flashers. The state values indicate the lights is to be turned ON or OFF.  Flashing is accomplished by  
 sending the lighting message with the state alternately ON or OFF.  A lighting command message must be  
 sent at least once per second.  It is the responsibility of the tractor designer to provide the correct  
 combination of lamp commands to meet local legislative directives.  
 Transmission Rate:  On change of lamp on/ off state.  Maximum period of 1 second between  
 messages.  No greater than 10 messages per second for all lights.
